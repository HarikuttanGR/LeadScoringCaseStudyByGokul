# LeadScoringCaseStudyByGokul
## Problem Statement
X Education is an online education company that sells courses to industry professionals. They receive a lot of leads, but their lead conversion rate is poor. They want to improve their lead conversion rate by identifying the most potential leads, also known as "Hot Leads". By focusing more on these potential leads, they aim to increase their lead conversion rate from the current 30% to around 80%.

## Business Objective:
The objective is to build a model that assigns a lead score to each lead, indicating the likelihood of conversion into a paying customer. This lead scoring model will help the sales team prioritize their efforts and focus on communicating with the leads that have a higher chance of conversion. Ultimately, this should improve the lead conversion rate and make the lead generation process more efficient.
